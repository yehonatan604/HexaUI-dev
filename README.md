## Installation

<hr/>

### step 1: install **_Rainbow Plus Ui_** via **NPM**:

To get started with Rainbow Plus UI, install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install rainbow-plus-ui@latest
```

### step 2: Install **_Tailwind CSS_** **(Required)**

Rainbow Plus UI is built with Tailwind CSS, you need to set up Tailwind in your project. Here's how to install Tailwind CSS with Vite and React:

1. Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

2. Initialize Tailwind by creating the default configuration files:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. Configure **_tailwind.config.js_** to include all of your React files and components by adding this content:

```bash
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './index.html',
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

4. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS file **_(e.g., src/index.css)_**:

```bash
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### step 3: Import **_Rainbow Plus UI_**'s CSS

After setting up Tailwind, ensure that you import Rainbow Plus UI‚Äôs CSS into your project. This CSS is necessary to apply the library's default styles.

In your main application file **_(e.g., src/main.jsx or src/index.js)_**, add the following import:

```bash
import "rainbow-plus-ui/dist/main.css";
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the components by importing them into your project. Here's a quick example of how to use the Button component:

```bash
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'rainbow-plus-ui/src';

function App() {
  return (
     <Button variant={Warning} size={Sizes.Lg}>
        {Warning}
      </Button>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Customization

Rainbow Plus UI components are built with Tailwind CSS at their core, offering extensive customization options to match your project‚Äôs needs:

- Utility Classes: Override component styles on the fly by passing in your own Tailwind utility classes.

- Theme Extension: Customize your entire application by extending Tailwind's configuration to introduce your own design tokens.

- Variants: Use built-in component variants to apply predefined styles consistently across your app.

- Component Themes: For more advanced styling, override the default component themes to enforce a cohesive design language throughout your project.

```bash
<List
  items={["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"]}
  fontSize={Sizes.Xl}
  gap={Sizes.Xs}
  variant={"random"}
  icons={[
    <GiBulletBill size={12} />,
    <GiAbbotMeeple size={12} />,
    <GiAbstract004 size={12} />,
  ]}
  byOrder
  listTitle={{
    text: "vertical list witha random variant and ordered icons",
    color: mode === "light" ? "text-zinc-800" : "text-zinc-200",
  }}
