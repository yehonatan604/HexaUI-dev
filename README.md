## Installation

<hr/>

### Step 1: Install **_React Hexa UI_** via **NPM**:

To get started with React Hexa UI, install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install react-hexa@latest
```

### Step 2: Install **_Tailwind CSS_**

React Hexa UI comes with built-in Tailwind CSS styles. However, if you want to use Tailwind classes or extend its configuration, you need to set up Tailwind in your project. Here's how to install Tailwind CSS with Vite and React:

1. Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

2. Initialize Tailwind by creating the default configuration files:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. Configure **_tailwind.config.js_** to include all of your React files and components by adding this content:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

4. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS file **_(e.g., src/main.css)_**:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Step 3: Wrap Your App with **_HexaUI_** Provider and Import Hexa UI's CSS

To use React Hexa UI, you must import Hexa UI's CSS and wrap your app with the `HexaUI` provider. This is required to set up the necessary context for the components.

In your main application file **_(e.g., src/main.jsx or src/main.tsx)_**, add the following:

```js
import { HexaUI } from "react-hexa";
import "react-hexa/css";

function Main() {
  return (
    <HexaUI>
      <App />
    </HexaUI>
  );
}

export default Main;
```

#### Optional: Customize the `HexaUI` Provider

You can pass optional `colors` and `gradients` to the `HexaUI` provider to override theme variant/s:

```js
<HexaUI
  colors={{ primary: "blue-500" } as TColorPalette}
  gradients={{ success: "from-blue-400 via-green-500 to-blue-700" } as TGradientPalette}
>
  <App />
</HexaUI>
```

These props are optional, but the provider must always wrap your app for Hexa UI to function properly.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the components by importing them into your project. Here's a quick example of how to use the `Button` component:

```js
import { Flex, Button } from "react-hexa";

function App() {
  return (
    <Flex className="gap-4">
      <Button options={{ bgVariant: "success" }}>Ok</Button>
      <Button options={{ bgVariant: "failure" }}>Cancel</Button>
    </Flex>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Customization

React Hexa UI components are built with Tailwind CSS at their core, offering extensive customization options to match your project‚Äôs needs:

- **Utility Classes:** Override component styles on the fly by passing in your own Tailwind utility classes.
- **Theme Extension:** Customize your entire application by extending Tailwind's configuration to introduce your own design tokens.
- **Variants:** Use built-in component variants to apply predefined styles consistently across your app.
- **Component Themes:** For more advanced styling, override the default component themes to enforce a cohesive design language throughout your project.

Here‚Äôs an example of extending themes with the `List` component:

```js
import { useTheme, List, ListStyleTypes, Sizes } from "react-hexa";

function App() {
  const { colors } = useTheme();

  const listOptions = {
    items: ["item 1", "item 2", "item 3"],
    textVariant: colors.Primary,
    listStyle: ListStyleTypes.Decimal,
    fontSize: Sizes.Sm,
    gap: 1,
  };

  return <List options={listOptions} />;
}

export default App;
```
